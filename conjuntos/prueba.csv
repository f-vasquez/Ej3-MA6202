letter signed CEA chairs Clinton tenure Janet Yellen busy running Fed Joseph Stiglitz left group Martin Baily tells know letter cites Friedman assumption economy grow percent Sanders comments credible economic research supports economic impacts magnitudes economists argue making kind claim undermines party best traditions evidence based policy making undermines reputation party responsible arithmetic Somewhat ironically group empirically minded wonks actually offer empirical critique study worried relying simply authority Democratic Party luminaries bat controversy level totally meaningless president era operating set circumstances managed pass complete legislative agenda combination partisan polarization entrenched House GOP majority extremely ambitious nature Sanders agenda makes totally inconceivable Sanders administration pass policy proposals Asking happen entire Sanders agenda enacted little like asking happen Sanders brought mid range game Golden State Warriors extent backing Sanders read Friedman paper fact going happen bigger problem questions Friedman forecasts level Friedman paper attacks Democratic Party wonks interesting window primary playing scenes Clinton achieved overwhelming party insider support Sanders campaign largely cut access kind para party policy wonk universe allow Sanders release campaign proposals pass muster traditional rules game managed virtue weakness harness larger significance Sanders project effort turn Democratic Party ideological party operates like progressive mirror image conservative Republican Party broad coalition interest groups mediated technocrats headline conclusion Friedman paper Bernienomics growth rate real gross domestic product rise annum real GDP capita higher projected current policy high rate growth Jeb Bush promised percent growth centrist liberal economists derisive Jeb friendly economists endorse claim Friedman promising CEA letter reflects similar level skepticism asked Dean Baker Center Economic Policy Research left wing Sanders friendly economists Washington policy world thought percent target nicest possible way suggested unrealistic Obviously opinions differ considerably merits aspects Sanders agenda questions slack employment labor force growth Friedman departs clearly economic consensus Consider chart laying Friedman view Bernienomics impact employment rate share adult population job Reasonable people disagree Sanders plans impact labor market virtually expert discussed believes reason employment rate declined old people larger share population today years ago main reason CBO expects employment rate fall future aging process set continue means employment level employment simply lower past Friedman contrast appears believe employment level right waning days Clinton administration good policy Friedman discuss demographic change issue paper Instead footnote argues women employment encouraged Paycheck Fairness Act raise wages women encouraging seek paid employment empirical evidence offered modest piece legislation impact large fact large share growth benefit Sanders agenda attributed consensus Democratic policy unusual positions Conversely Sanders distinctive signature ideas certainly depress labor force participation sympathetic view example college free young people work time instead school work time students currently work time reduce hours cut zero proponent free college likely describe benefits free college universe certainly foreign countries college cheaper United States fewer school age people labor force token Sanders Medicare expanded Social Security plans certainly increase number people retire early Free health care easier retired year Social Security benefits kick generous Social Security reduce intact savings people need benefits kick higher taxes finance Medicare plan working slightly lucrative necessarily bad thing reducing old people need toil nice idea like free college tends cut Friedman view Bernienomics create surge employment noteworthy CEA chairs criticizing Friedman bother run detailed explanation problems paper percent figure simply absurd face good relying authority generate media coverage extent mission accomplished coverage generated better worse entire premise Sanders campaign existing Democratic Party establishment needs overthrown imperious dismissals establishment figures hurt Sanders policy director Warren Gunnels told Danielle Kurtzleben economists question establishment establishment claimed unbothered criticisms bother told bothers fact kids living poverty nearly major country earth Bernie sympathizers like Week Ryan Cooper veteran left wing political operative Jeff Hauser simply view letter signers non credible referring old Goolsbee column Tyson service corporate boards Sanders skeptics style response worrying Paul Krugman example wrote letter said response concerns corrupt looking jobs Hillary problem dismissals critiques Friedman praise Sanders plan way telling informative Friedman paper critiques Sanders core constituency simply care Sanders running style campaign unusual prominent Democrat extremely common Republican Marco Rubio example proposed large tax cut balanced budget amendment increase defense spending prevent cuts Social Security Medicare people currently near retirement obviously possible problem Rubio GOP primary GOP primary like
